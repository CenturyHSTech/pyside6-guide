# A Semi-complete Guide to PySide6
A set of demos, exercises, and challenges designed to learn to design GUIs using Pyside6

## Goal:
Create a repository/codex of all PySide6 layouts and widgets to help others (especially my students) make amazing graphical apps with PySide6.

## Getting Started/Notes
I used poetry to manage my dependencies (see `pyproject.toml`). If you use pipenv instead or simply install all necessary libraries, you'll want to either review the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` or the import statements in each file to know what to install.

### Using Poetry
Do the following:

1. Spawn a poetry shell: `poetry env activate`
2. Run `poetry update`
3. [In VS Code] Choose 
    * Command Palette > Python: Select Interpreter then 
    * select the poetry shell.

## Change log:
### Version 0.1.0
Not yet released
* just getting started
* the plan is to import code from [A Semi-complete Guide to PyQt6](https://github.com/HundredVisionsGuy/Guide-to-PyQt6)
